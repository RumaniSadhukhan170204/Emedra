E-Medra transforms the way medical records are handled by combining blockchain, encryption, and smart contracts for secure and controlled health data management.

✅ 1. Medical Record Upload

The process begins when a patient uploads a medical file such as:

Test reports

Lab results

Prescriptions

X-ray/MRI scans

These records are first encrypted locally, ensuring that no one — not even the server — can view the plain data.

✅ 2. Blockchain Storage & Immutable Hashing

Once encrypted, the record is:

Stored securely in decentralized storage

Assigned a unique hash on the blockchain

This hash proves the authenticity of the document.

✔ Records become tamper-proof
✔ No one can alter or delete them
✔ Every version is trackable
